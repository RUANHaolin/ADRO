### "Table 1.xlsx"

"Table 1.xlsx" records the average and median (in brackets) relative gaps ($\%$) to the exact objective value among $100$ instances. "MM" denotes the marginal moment model solved by the initial iteration of GIP algorithm and "GIP" denotes implementing the GIP algorithm for at most $50$ iterations. 


### "Table 2.xlsx"

"Table 2.xlsx" records the average and median (in brackets) of computation times in seconds and relative gaps ($\%$) to the exact objective values among $100$ random instances with continuous decisions (sheet "continuous decisions") and with discrete decisions (sheet "discrete decisions"). Here, ``EXACT'' further denotes the exact approach that solves problem (20) as a semidefinite program.


### "Table 3.xlsx"

"Table 3.xlsx" records the sum of weekly maximal bed shortages (sheet "criterion 1") and all-day maximal bed shortage (sheet "criterion 1") (percentage of bed shortage decreases compared with iteration~$0$ in brackets) of the three models.


### "Table 4.xlsx"

"Table 4.xlsx" records the performance of the ELDR approximation under different relaxed ambiguity sets: $T=5$ (sheet "T = 5"), $T=10$ (sheet "T = 10") and $T=20$ (sheet "T = 20"). Here, the symbol `$-$' denotes that the GIP model does not improve over the PCM model or the ${\rm GIP}^+$ model does not improve over the GIP model.


### "Table 5.xlsx"

"Table 5.xlsx" records the computation times in seconds of the ${\rm GIP}$ model (sheet "GIP") and the ${\rm GIP}^+$ model (sheet "GIP+").


### "Figure 1\_left panel.eps" and "Figure 1\_right panel.eps"

These two figures visualize the average bed shortages of different models over $50$ random instances and $10000$ testing samples: sum of weekly maximal bed shortages ("Figure 1_left panel.eps") and all-day maximal bed shortages ("Figure 1\_right panel.eps").
